# Digital Media Concentration
The addition of the Digital Literacy Core course at Columbia University will equip students with real-world, practical skills and better their understanding of the digital world we live in.  Columbia prides itself on its Core Curriculum, a "set of common courses required of all undergraduates...[to] cultivate a critical and creative intellectual capacity." [^1] The Digital Literacy Core course would surely help cultivate these students' intellectual capacities, and open up a whole new world for learning, growing and understanding in the digital space. This course will not only transform the ways students approach every day problems, from note-taking to version controlling documents; it will also allow them to tackle issues in whatever discipline they choose with an understanding of how digital tools can help them make their work more efficient, productive and insightful. 

## The History of the Core
The Columbia College Core Curriculum, which now consists of Literature Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, Art Humanities, Music Humanities, University Writing, Frontiers of Science and a Global Core, foreign language, science and physical education requirement, did not always contain such a complex variety of core classes. The idea of the core began in 1917, with a class titled "War Issues." This class was intended to help students understand the causes and effects of warfare in a small, seminar-style classroom. Along with the language requirement, these were some of the first mandatory courses at Columbia. The Core Courses are not set in stone and permanent; they have evolved over time, in response to student criticism, external factors and initiatives from various professors. 

Most recently, Columbia College added Frontiers of Science in 2004 to "change the way students think about questions of science and about the world around them" [^5]. However, ten years after its addition, the Columbia Core Committee is reevaluating the Frontiers of Science formula. According to the Spectator article written in February, 2014, the course has appeared "to fail so completely in generating a sentiment of urgency and saliency toward its source material" [^6]. This class teaches students a bunch of facts about science, about discoveries and about the world around them, yet fails to make the material relevant and necessary for students. Clearly, the Core courses that are most fundamental and helpful provide students with relevant and engaging material that will allow them to thrive in the world around them. 

Moreover, this proposed Digital Literacy course will not teach students esoteric technologies or random facts; rather, like University Writing, this course will help undergraduates write and understand information in the digital space. It will educate students with a strong foundation of digital practices. It will teach digital literacy not as an end goal, but as a skill that can be practiced and developed. Adding Digital Literacy to the Core requirement would not simply show them how to code or how to apply specific technologies; this course will allow students to build fundamental skills necessary to navigate the digital world and to think about questions of the world around them in terms of the digital space.

#The Need

It is fairly obvious to students these days that the world is changing rapidly--and that the rate of change is accelerating. Technology is evolving at an ever-increasing rate, and students have a hard time keeping up with these changes. With the addition of a course focused on building a foundation in the digital discipline, students would better understand the digital landscape and use the available digital tools to their advantage. This course would provide an invaluable education in a necessary discipline to thrive in our digital world. 

This Core course will educate students in strategies for our digital world that are essential to staying relevant in this turbulent ecosystem. The last three years in particular have seen an explosion of demand for course topics like: Version Control, Digital Strategy, Digital Governance, Search Marketing, Big Data Management, and Analytics Strategy. 

In an article published in *The Guardian* in 2011, journalist Sarah Knight explains the necessity of educating students on digital practices. She argues, "increasingly digital literacy is vital for learning itself. Digital tools such as virtual learning environments, e-portfolios, and social networking software for peer mentoring are now common within further and higher education and students without the skills to navigate them risk suffering an inferior student experience at best, and being left completely at worst." [^2] Understanding at least the basics of coding is a necessary skill as digital becomes more and more intertwined with our world. The skills taught in this course will be extremely valuable for Columbia University students, to help them stay ahead of the curve and to understand at least the basics of our digital ecosystem.

While Columbia does not yet offer foundations course of digital tools, other universities have began to offer these courses and have had great success. Some institutions have started centers and programs around this discipline. For instance, DePaul University's School of Computing teaches students a variety of skills to help them "to develop the next killer app, secure your company’s infrastructure, or be the architect of a new global technology solution."[^4] These courses are designed to give students a strong foundation in digital skills to empower them to thrive in whatever discipline they choose. As one of the top elite academic institutions in the country, Columbia University would benefit from adding such a relevant, growing, and practical topic to its Core Curriculum. 

# Plan of Action
These four steps will provide students with an elite digital literacy education. The ultimate goal is to provide students with a strong digital foundation to thrive in our ever-evolving digital world:

## Form a Committee of Interested Students and Faculty Members
When it comes to educating students about digital, most people agree that the education is necessary, but do not know where to start. They ask: *"What tools should be taught? What proficiencies are fundamental for establishing a strong core digital literacy? Who chooses what digital tools should be taught?*

In order to understand the answers to these questions, a Digital Literacy Core committee, built of interested students and faculty members, will meet to discuss these issues. This committee will assess current competencies and readiness to determine what kinds of education programs are needed. Through encouraging discussions, conducting student surveys, and interviewing experts, this committee will identify the focus of the course. Moreover, because of the constantly evolving nature of digital practices, the Committee will meet before every semester to reassess student need and potentially alter the curriculum. Like Frontiers of Science core course at Columbia, while the individual topics taught may vary, this core course will integrate digital practices into the foundation of Columbia Education.

## Develop a Curriculum
The Curriculum for Digital Literacy Core course will be centered on building core digital competencies. The aforementioned committee will develop the preliminary curriculum. The curriculum will likely include topics such as: Command Line Basics, GitHub and Markdown, Zotero, Python Basics, and Creating a Website. 

## Identify Professors 
The next step is to identify professors with expertise in these areas or an interest in developing an expertise in digital literacy. Professors could range from graduate students in the Humanities to high-level computer science professors. Professors would need to necessary expertise in the areas taught in the class. Training could be provided for professors who demonstrated interest, but did not yet have the expertise in all of the digital areas. 

## Propose Course to Core Curriculum Committee in Fall 2014
After the Committee has developed a curriculum and identified potential professors, the Committee will propose this course to the Core Curriculum Committee in Fall 2014. 

# Conclusion
In summary, the addition of the Digital Literacy Core course at Columbia College will ensure all students leave with the necessary skills and understanding to thrive in our digital world. As the Core Curriculum states, the Core intends to provide "the skills and habits honed by the Core—observation, analysis, argument, imaginative comparison, respect for ideas, nuances, and differences—provide a rigorous preparation for life as an intelligent citizen in today’s complex and changing world." [^3]. Columbia University must not only prepare its students through mandatory writing, philosophy, literature, music, art and science disciplines; it must build upon this solid framework by adding a necessary course in Digital Literacy.
